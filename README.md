Welcome! 👋
This repository contains slide decks from technical sessions, workshops, and talks I’ve delivered over the years. The content covers a variety of topics across software engineering, cloud technologies, AI, development tooling, and best practices.

Feel free to browse, reference, and reuse the materials (with attribution). I hope they help you learn, teach, or spark new ideas. 🚀

If you have questions about any session or would like me to present one of these topics again — reach out!
